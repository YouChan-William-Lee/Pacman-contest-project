  BRAINSTORMING 30-08-2022

  Must use 2 AI-related techniques.
  The first we plan to use is Heuristic Search Algoritms.
  The second we plan to use is Monte Carlo Tree Search.
  Could also possibly use Reinforcement Learning since that will be covered relatively soon.

  Try using 2 Offensive agents and also 1 Offensive and 1 Defensive agent.

  We can try using A* algorithm for heuristic search. We will need to come up with a heuristic.

  General Ideas:
    - Try having the offensive agent(s) rush for a food pellet and take as many food pellets as it can before returning.
    - Maybe try switching from Offensive to Defense
    - Can try alpha-beta search
    - Can try blocking path to half through defensive agents.
    - Have to come up with a way to evaluate when to go home.
    - When we have two offensive agents, can try to divide the food among them.
